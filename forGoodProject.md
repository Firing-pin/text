 ## What does not qualify as a good project?
  - A static website, anything with fixed content which displays the same information to every visitor. e.g. Your portfolio website, a business landing page, one-page website, one-page game, etc.
  - Here are some rules of thumb you can use to determine whether your project qualifies or not:

    - Did it take you less than 20 hours to build? If yes, it's probably not a good project.
    - Can website builders like Wix or Webflow be used to replicate your project? If yes, it's probably not a good project.

*Understand that you'll be interviewing for a web "app" developer and not a web "site" developer; don't get confused between the two. We don't have anything against building websites per se, but you need to build a webapp to get accepted into roc8.careers.*

What are some examples of web apps?
    - Google Maps, Microsoft Teams, Outlook Mail, Zomato, Flipkart, etc. HRs of these companies are looking for web dev talent frantically. 
    - There's above-average money, and a great career in becoming a webapp developer.

With that out of the way, let's address some frequently asked questions.

## Is cloning okay?
   - Cloning is allowed. Feel free to add your twist: Build a Tinder for books, and name it Binder. Build Facebook for non-profits and volunteers. Build Instagram for       quotes only.

## What are we not evaluating you on?
  - You don't need to have revolutionary ideas. We have Product Managers for that.
  - You don't need to have a great design sense. We have Product Designers for that.
  - The above things are good-to-have, i.e. they certainly add value but it's not expected from you to have these skills.


 ## What are we evaluating you on?
You'll be working in a team where you are bringing your technical expertise to the table. Complexity in your webapps is what we'll be evaluating you on.

## Can you give me ideas of what would qualify?
Now we are talking. Here are some examples that would qualify:

  - Social media application (Twitter, Facebook, etc.)
  - E-commerce application (Amazon, Flipkart, etc.)
  - Media player (Spotify)
  - Productivity app (Trello, Asana, Evernote, etc.)
  - Messaging app (WhatsApp)
  - Booking app (MakeMyTrip)
      - Whoa! Wait. Wouldn't every project take a lot of time then?

*Yes, it takes time and commitment to make good projects. The reason why software salaries are good is there's a shortage of supply of good developers. Most of you reading this wouldn't do it. If you do it, we'd be happy to elevate you into a good full-time job.*

Glad you're reading further. Let's go deeper into a good project.

## What features should I aim for?
For any app, you can classify a feature into core (without which the app cannot function) and auxiliary (which helps in the core function). Let's take the example of an e-commerce app. The primary goal of the app is to place an order. Here are some features along with their categorization:

  - Product Listing - This is a core feature. You cannot place an order without seeing the list of products.
  - Address Input - This is again a core feature. Without your address, the order can't be shipped.
  - Checkout Flow - This is definitely a core feature.
  - Wishlist - Now this is an auxiliary feature. If you can't add a product to wishlist, it doesn't hamper your ability to place an order.
      
  `Your app should contain all the core features.`

Start by writing the goal of your app beforehand. That will make it easier for you to decide whether a feature is core or auxiliary.

## Here are some examples of goals:

  - Social media application - Share what's on your mind and see what others are doing
  - Media player - Play a song/video seamlessly
  - Productivity app - Add to-do items, assign deadlines, get a sorted view of everything that needs to be done
  - Messaging app - Able to chat with someone, i.e. messages should be sent and delivered very fast
  - Booking app - Find a good deal (search by your location, add filters, book a trip)

## What technical features should I showcase?
  Okay, let's talk in quantifiable terms now. Your app should:
    - Be a Single Page Application (SPA)
    *If you haven't heard about SPA yet, don't worry. Now's a good time to read about what it is. In short, your web app has faster transitions compared to loading entire new pages.*

   - Have multiple routes

   - Have more than 3 core features

   - Talk to a backend

   - Be deployed in production mode

   - Have all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for core features

### Additionally,

   - At least two projects should have some concept of user management (signup, login, forgot password, personalization)
   - At least two projects should use some kind of database or datastore.

`Some good-to-have features which will fetch you brownie points are responsiveness (i.e. a good looking and usable mobile view), having meta tags for link previews, dark mode, etc.`

## Should I showcase variety?
Definitely! Think about it. The aim is to impress someone enough that they hire you, right? Don't build 5 e-commerce apps then. Show that you can do different things.

Here are some examples to show variety (pick any 5):

   - A React app
   - A vanilla JS app (this will help you in interviews as well)
   - A React app with offline capabilities i.e. PWA
   - A Chrome / VS Code / Firefox plugin
   - A React Native app
   - A npm package published with tests, docs, and versioning
   - A REST / GraphQL API

*Note that this is not a comprehensive list - your project does not need to fall into one of the above examples. If you can showcase variety, our hiring partners are ready to take fast-track interviews.*

   - Are full-stack apps required?
No, but make sure you're consuming APIs in your app to make it dynamic. Feel free to use fake APIs or backend as a service (like Firebase, Hasura, Amplify, etc.).

   - Can I make a backend project?
Yes, you can. But only one or two. Make sure you document your APIs, follow REST / GraphQL best practices, add tests, and have versioning in place.

## Where can I find some inspiration?
Here are some places you can browse for ideas:

   - Play Store, App Store
   - Firefox Addons Store, Chrome Plugin Store
   - Product Hunt, Show Hacker News
   - /r/AppIdeas, /r/SomebodyMakeThis
   - Dribbble, Behance

## TL;DR
Here's a quick summary:

   - The overall goal of your portfolio is to impress someone enough that they hire you.
   - Cloning is okay.
   - Build web apps, not web sites. Showcase complexity in your projects. A complex project should take you at least 20 hours to build.
   - Aim for variety.
